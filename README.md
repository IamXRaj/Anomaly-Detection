# Anomaly-Detection
This project uses the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect anomalous user behavior in login sessions. It simulates normal and abnormal user activity based on login duration, tab switches, keystroke speed, and idle time. Anomalies are detected, labeled, and exported for further analysis.
